<h1> Research Abstract </h1>
<h3> Feature Engineering and Predictive Modeling
for Financial Time Series Data </h3>
<p>
This paper presents a series of results achieved by attempting to
predict the closing price of a financial market time series. The data
source was Yahoo Finance, containing 19 years worth of daily stock
information, and an ETF tracking the Nasdaq 100 index (QQQ) was
chosen as the specific dataset to predict. A set of features for financial
time series data was engineered and five (5) models were explored:
Random Forest, LeNet, custom LeNet, ResNet, and a LSTM. The
goal was to use to Deep Neural Network models, while engineering
features that allow reliable prediction with only a single day worth
of information. The best performing models managed to achieve accuracy ranges between 83-85%, showing that the features engineered
have predictive value.
